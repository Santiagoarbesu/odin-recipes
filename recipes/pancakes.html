    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A pancake, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat
      cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may
      contain eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a
      griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological
      evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric
      societies.
